Crime is an age-old issue that continues to impact society significantly, with modern criminals utilizing advanced scientific methods. This project aims to enhance crime prediction and prevention through machine learning and data science.

Problem Statement
Criminals often target familiar regions, affecting both quality of life and economic progress. By identifying crime hotspots and predicting the nature, location, and time of crimes, we can assist law enforcement in taking proactive measures.

Objective
To create a model for predicting crime using machine learning algorithms on a dataset extracted from official sources. The model will be trained and validated to accurately predict crime types in specific areas.

Methodology
Data Collection: Extract dataset from official sites.
Feature Analysis: Examine geographic features, age, gender, etc.
Model Training: Use Python to train a machine learning model on the training dataset.
Validation: Validate the model with the test dataset.
Visualization: Use bar graphs, pie charts, etc., for clear crime representation.
Benefits
Improved societal awareness.
Enhanced crime prediction and prevention.
Faster crime-solving capabilities for law enforcement.
Tools and Technologies
